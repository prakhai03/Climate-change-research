# 🌍 Climate Change Project

This repository contains my work on a climate change prediction and visualization project. It focuses on analyzing wind and pressure data from atmospheric models to better understand and forecast weather patterns associated with climate change. The project applies machine learning techniques—particularly deep learning and self-organizing maps (SOMs)—to extract insights and create compelling visualizations.

## 🧠 Core Features

- Processing and cleaning of historical atmospheric data (wind and pressure fields).
- Use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for weather pattern classification.
- Self-organizing maps (SOMs) to cluster and visualize complex spatial patterns.
- Extraction of wind/pressure sections and image-based data analysis.
- Visual comparison of predictions and real-world data using color-coded image maps.
